# RESTful Producer-Consumer Apps

Our API will:

- Handle CRUD for an item (weâ€™re going to use superheroes)
- Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/superheroes and http://example.com/api/superheroes/:superhero_id)
- Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
- Return JSON data (since we are using node)
- Log all requests to the console

This API will in turn be consumed by a client GUI running AngularJS which will be provided or any other method the user wishes to entail (eg: POSTMAN, CURL, or their own browser application capable of consuming RESTful services)

# FOLDER STRUCTURE FOR:

serverAPI: (finished)
-
- app/
----- models/
---------- superheroes.js  // our superheroes model
- node_modules/     // created by npm. holds our dependencies/packages
- package.json      // define all our node app and dependencies
- server.js         // configure our application and create routes
- routes.js //this is included in the server.js file (would separate if app was bigger and for production)

CLI Instructions:
- cd to directory of package.json file and run $ npm install
- run with node '$ node server.js' (or optional to run app through nodemon instead of node '$ sudo npm install -g nodemon' and '$ nodemon server.js')


clientConsumer: (in progress)
-
AngularJS client (still in progress)
- Angular/
----- css/
---------- bootstrap.min.css   	//bootstrap framework
---------- custom.css	       	//custom CSS
----- js/
---------- angular.min.js	//angular framework
---------- app.js		//angular module and controller
----- index.html		//the homepage
- JQuery/     		//independent work in progress
- Restangular/       	//independent work in progress


Final-MEAN-App: (in progress)
-
This is the final version of the project merging both the client application and the server. The client app is hosted by the server on its homepage while RESTful calls are being initiated and handled. Running is the same as the CLI instruction for the server (described above)
To do: Will create a final .sh script for linux to automatically start up both MongoDB and the server.


Current Bugs:

critical:
1) FIX ADDED ON GET SOMETIMES -> $$hashKey: "object:95"
non-critical:
1) FLUSH INPUTS WITH FUNCTION EVERY TIME METHOD IS CHANGED 
2) "Error: [ngRepeat:dupes] http://errors.angularjs.org/... when using POST
3) Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. (SOMETIMES)
4) ALERT NOTIFICATIONS FIX AND MAKE ANOTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASE 3 AND CASE 4 NOTIFICATIONS

Run instructions:
- run through index.html and make sure js/app.js has the proper MongoDB collection url. 
NOTE: currently only the GET functionality is working.

# DEPENDENCIES FOR:

- API: express + body-parser + mongoose
- Consumer: AngularJS + Bootstrap + bootswatch(Slate) + (optionally to be added are the ngResource and ngRoute modules or RestangularJS)
